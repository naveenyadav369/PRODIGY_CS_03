📥 Installation
bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-analyzer-pro.git
cd password-analyzer-pro

# Run directly (no dependencies required)
python password_checker.py
🎯 Quick Start
python
# Basic usage example
from password_strength import PasswordStrengthChecker

checker = PasswordStrengthChecker()
password = "MySecureP@ssw0rd2024!"

score, feedback = checker.check_strength(password)
strength = checker.get_strength_level(score)

print(f"Strength: {strength}")
print(f"Score: {score}/11")
💡 Usage Examples
Check Password Strength:
text
Password: "hello123"
✅ Good length (8+ characters)
